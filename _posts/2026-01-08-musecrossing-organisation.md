We’ve created a new GitHub organization called MuseCrossing to gather the projects and experiments that support writers: lightweight annotation tools, examples, and other resources that make writing and organising notes smoother.

MuseCrossing is meant to be a friendly, shared space where we can group related efforts, publish examples, and make it easier for curious writers to find what they need. This is primarily a community-focused move: the goal is clearer organisation and a nicer place to showcase our work.

What this means for you
- Nothing dramatic: the tools and resources remain available and we’ll share links to projects and documentation from the MuseCrossing organisation page.
- If you’re interested in the projects, follow the organisation on GitHub and star the repositories you find useful — it helps others discover the work.
- If you have ideas, examples, or questions, please open a discussion or issue on the relevant repository. We welcome feedback from writers and creative users first and foremost.

Why MuseCrossing?
- To group related tools and examples under one clear identity.
- To make discovery easier for writers and creators who want to experiment with annotations and lightweight workflows.
- To provide a friendly, community-oriented place for sharing resources and inspiration.

What’s next
- We’ll add clearer links, documentation, and example projects to the organisation page.
- We plan to publish short guides and demos aimed at writers (not just developers), so anyone can try the tools quickly.

Thank you for your interest and support. Welcome to MuseCrossing — we look forward to building this space with you.
